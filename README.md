• Solved a task in wich I generated multiple images using a specific prompt ("Pink laptop in a supermarket") using Stable Diffusion and Keras libraries.

• Added a mask to the image so that the object is kept on the image while the background disappears.

• Used cv2 and MoviePy to add labels to the images, as well as to create a short compilation with the generated images.
